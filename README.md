# Introduction

**This project is aimed at building software for parsing pgn chess file based on SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation).**

It requires:

- CMake 3.22
- GCC 12.1 and C++20 standard
- Ubuntu 22.04 or the Docker image `iainttho/ubuntu:pgn` based on Ubuntu 22.04.

# Build and Run

**Running the Docker Container**

The image `iainttho/ubuntu:pgn` comes with preinstalled required packages:
- gdb, valgrind, pytest

Start/Stop the Container:
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `docker-compose down --remove-orphans`

**Building, Testing, and Running**

Enter the container:

- `docker exec -it pgn_ubuntu bash`
- `cd && cd pgn-parser`
  
Scripts are available to build, test the project:

- `./compile.sh`
    - The executable pgn_parser is found in either ./build/ or ./pytest/ folder
    - `cd pytest`
    - `./pgn_parser <file_path>`

- `./test.sh`

# Features
This parser supports the PGN format based on : <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation

- The movetext is based on SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation)
- Disambiguation is supported by checking `VerifyIfKingBeingCheck_` before accepting a move
- PGN file format error detection
- Output format:
  - The state of the board at the end of the game, in the form of an 8x8 grid.
  - Initial state

```

-   Runtime polymorphism in `class Move;`
-   Dispatch using `std::variant`, `std::visit` and `CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)` in `template <typename ConcretePiece> class BasePiece;`
-   Benchmarks Virtual vs CRTP: https://quick-bench.com/q/nyVP4cIAEawAsL0pgfThuy3X8ZQ

# Notes
I am still working on developing this parser. Please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions.

-   Add Iterative mode
-   Support Forward-Backward interaction
-   Process tags and comment
-   ✔ Improve performace and readability
-   Cover more file format error
-   ✔ Improve test coverage
-   ✔ Handle error
-   Overload piece swap
-   ✔ Handle Color (White/Blacl) more elegant
-   ✔ Pull Request!
